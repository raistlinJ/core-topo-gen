"""Planning subpackage initialization and public plan computation helpers.

Purpose: provide small, focused computation modules that derive counts and
allocation plans for each scenario section (hosts, routers, services, etc.).
This allows the CLI, web preview, and phased builders to share consistent
semantics while enabling fine-grained unit tests.
